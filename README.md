## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It provides a vast collection of coding challenges that cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, databases, and more. This repository aims to provide solutions to these challenges

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository

2. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/(your-username)/LeetCode-CodeChallenges.git
    ```


    there go to the folder where you want to work on, then make a new folder with the name of the language in which you want to solve and then make a new file with the name of the problem you want to solve

    ```bash
    cd LeetCode-CodeChallenges
    ```

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
        
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added new problem"
    ```

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

    > **make a `pull request`**

    > **we will `review` and `merge` it**


3. **Install any necessary dependencies:**

    Depending on the programming language used for the solutions, you may need to install specific dependencies. Refer to the individual solution files for more details.

4. **Run the solutions:**

    Each solution is contained within its own file or folder. Navigate to the appropriate directory and run the solution using the relevant command for the programming language.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```bash
LeetCode-CodeChallenges/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ arrays/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dart/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ python*/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ strings/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dart/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ python*/
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
> *python can be added in future

Each challenge is categorized based on its topic (e.g., arrays, strings, etc.). Within each topic folder, you will find subfolders for different programming languages (e.g., Java, Dart, Python). The solutions are provided in the respective language folders.
